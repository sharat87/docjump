# DocJump

DocJump provides a fuzzy finder (on hitting `Ctrl+G`) for methods, fields etc. in documentation pages for popular software
development libraries and frameworks including Java and Python. Open source and works completely offline.

The default hotkey to launch DocJump is `Ctrl+G`, but can be customized in the add-on's options page. The icon in the
URL bar can also be clicked to launch DocJump.

Here's a preview of what this add-on offers:
